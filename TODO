- introduce alpha-beta pruning to minimax algorithm. 
  - need to fold over the columns rather than straight map?
- change the evaluation so that forced winning after fewer steps is worth more than forced winning after more steps (other player might not move optimally)
- If AI thinks all cols lead to failure, will currently choose the last one. If this is full there's a problem, and it will eventually fill up in this case
  - if it does choose a full column, it means that it thinks it can't win. Maybe need to make full columns have a worse score than a losing move. 
  - need to deal with the situation where all columns are full. This means a draw.
- clean up the messy use of modules
  - move choose_column function into the player module?
- for better game-play, randomise the choice from equal-valued moves
  - but ensure tests are deterministic
